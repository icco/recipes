Based off of [Just One Cookbook's Recipe](http://www.justonecookbook.com/tamagoyaki-japanese-rolled-omelette).

## Ingredients

 - 3 large eggs
 - 2 Tbsp neutral flavor oil (vegetable, canola, etc)
 - 2 tsp granulated sugar
 - 1 tsp soy sauce
 - 1 tsp mirin

## Directions

 1. Heat the pan over medium heat, dip a folded paper towel in oil and apply to the pan. Put a little bit of egg mixture to see if the pan is hot. When you hear the sizzling sound, pour a thin layer of egg mixture in the pan, tilting to cover the bottom of the pan.

 2. Poke the air bubbles to release the air. After the bottom of the egg has set but still soft on top, start rolling into a log shape from one side to the other.

 3. Move the rolled omelette to the side where you started to roll, and apply oil to the pan with a paper towel, even under the omelette. Pour the egg mixture to cover the bottom of the pan again. Make sure to lift the omelette to spread the mixture underneath.

 4. When the new layer of egg has set and still soft on top, start rolling from one side to the other.

 5. Repeat until all egg is used.
